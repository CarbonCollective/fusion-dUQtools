# Dash

The dash subcommand opens a dashboard to explore the results of the UQ runs.

This requires duqtools to be installed with additional dependencies:

`pip install duqtools[dash]`

or, when installing the development version:

`pip install -e .[dash]`

To run the command:

`duqtools dash`

Check out [the command-line interface](/command-line-interface/#dash) for more info on how to use this command.
